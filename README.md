## Summary

Bookly is a scheduling and planning app that allows you to
create your own events and invite team members to help you.

How it works:

1. Create a profile to get started
2. Create your first event
3. Add a team member by providing their first and last name and email (they can edit their profile later)
4. Once they accept your invite and create a profile, you can add them to your events

### A few nice to knows:

Only you can see team members added to your roster, and only you can see
which team members are on your events.

In v1, each user gets one default team upon registering. The ability to create multiple teams
and assign team members to specific teams will come in the next iteration.
